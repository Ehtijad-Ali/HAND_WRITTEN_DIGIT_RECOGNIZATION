# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for MNIST Digit Classification 🧠📊
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The CNN model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, two popular libraries for deep learning tasks. The MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 grayscale images of digits (0-9), is used to train and evaluate the model's performance. The project covers several stages, including data preprocessing, model construction, training, and evaluation.

## Key Features:
The project begins with loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset, normalizing the pixel values to a range between 0 and 1. The model architecture follows a typical CNN structure, starting with convolutional layers that help extract features from the images. These layers are followed by max-pooling layers that reduce the spatial dimensions, and the final layers are fully connected, allowing the model to output class probabilities for each of the ten digits. 🔍🖼️

The CNN model is trained for five epochs, utilizing callbacks like EarlyStopping to halt training if the model reaches a high accuracy threshold, and ModelCheckpoint to save the best-performing model. LearningRateScheduler is used to adjust the learning rate dynamically during training, optimizing the model's performance. After training, the model is evaluated on the test dataset, with performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 📈🏆

## Project Structure:
The repository is organized into several directories:

#### data 🗂️: Contains the MNIST dataset.
#### models 🧳: Stores the trained CNN model.
#### src 🖥️: Holds the Python script that contains the main implementation of the project.
#### Root directory: Includes the requirements.txt file for installing the necessary dependencies and a README.md file for project documentation. 📂
## Training and Results:
The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, where it learns to classify the handwritten digits. After completing the training, the model achieves impressive accuracy on the test set, with results typically reaching over 99%. This high accuracy demonstrates the power of convolutional neural networks for image classification tasks. The final model is saved and can be used for predictions on new handwritten digit images. 🚀🤖

## How to Run the Project:
To run the project, users need to clone the repository and install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file. Once the environment is set up, the user can execute the main.py file, which will load the dataset, build the model, train it, and save the final trained model. 💻🔧

## Conclusion:
This project serves as an excellent introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks, specifically using the MNIST dataset. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and the training process is optimized with several techniques, such as early stopping and learning rate scheduling. The project provides a strong foundation for applying CNNs to more complex image recognition tasks in the future. 🌟
